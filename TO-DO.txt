Potential Futrue To-DO's:
- Create a Docker image that would spin up an image of the app with the necessary dependencies
- Scalability:
    - Use rabbitmq for message queue and celery for task enqueueing
    - If the applications had more views and routes, use flask blueprints and an application factory


Tests:
- ENDPOINT TESTING
    - If a date is supplied that is not in the DB
    - A correct date

Notes:
- DB:
    Typically the referred DB in your config file would point to different DB instancces, but for this example we will use the same DB instance.
